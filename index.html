    <p>I've spent the last three years working on bespoke apps and websites using PHP and Javascript. My areas of expertise include: the Laravel PHP framework, MVC and automated testing using Behat and PHPUnit. I enjoy approaching all projects with a focus ensuring longevity and maintainability of code through applying best practices, design patterns and an optimistic but pragmatic attitude. 
    </p><p>I am also passionate about keeping an eye out for paradigm shifts and keeping a finger on the pulse as new tools and technologies emerge.
